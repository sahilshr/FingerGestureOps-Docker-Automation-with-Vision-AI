# FingerGestureOps-Docker-Automation-with-Vision-AI

FingerGestureOps is an innovative system that leverages computer vision to automate Docker container deployment using hand gestures. By detecting specific finger patterns through a webcam, this solution triggers backend processes to launch or scale Docker containers seamlessly. Built using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and AWS services like Lambda, API Gateway, and EC2, the project demonstrates the integration of real-time gesture recognition with cloud-based automation.
